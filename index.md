## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2, Part 1

My favorite part of this lab was how it made C++ feel real for the first time. Since this was only our second lab, and I am quite new to coding since this is only my minor, I was still getting used to the idea that code isn’t just abstract numbers and words. I really liked seeing how a simple program could interact with me through the terminal. In this lab, we created three string variables, prompted the user for a singular noun, a plural noun, and a present tense verb, and then used std::cin to store whatever the user typed. What made it fun was watching those inputs get inserted back into sentences using std::cout. The fact that the output was mad libs made it even more fun and enjoyable, since we could actually see our code being put into action and see the results of our mad libs. This experience made programming feel a lot less intimidating and a lot more exciting.

* Lab 4, Part 2

My favorite part of this lab was that the concept of a guessing game made it feel a lot more interactive and entertaining to code. This was because I was coding rules that emulated an actual game. This was also my introduction to coding if and else if statements. It was a new concept that I learned during the readings and the lecture and it was interesting being able to put it into use and actually see what it does. I also got more practice with storing and printing things using std::cin and std::cout. It was cool this time using it as, again, we were coding statements that would result in game outputs which make it a lot more interesting.

* Lab 7, Part 1

My favorite part of this lab was practicing more complex if and else if chains and command line argument handling. Compared to Lab 4, where the if and else if statements were a bit more simple and the logic was a simple comparison between guess and secret, here I had to construct compound Boolean expressions with && and || to enforce multiple conditions for each street. It was a good exercise in thinking carefully about order of evaluation.The command line handling reminded me of the blackjack lab, but instead of two string arguments, I worked with four inputs, street, day, hour, and minute, and had to validate each using bounds checks and std::stoi for type conversion. Both labs used command-line arguments, but in slightly different ways. In the blackjack lab, we mainly used command_line.size() to check that the user supplied exactly two card names, and then command_line.at(1) and command_line.at(2) to read those values. In Lab 7, we also used command_line.at(#) to get specific arguments, but this time there were four inputs, street, day, hour, and minute, and each one needed more detailed validation. It felt like a reasonable step up, that wasn’t too challenging, but still had us level up in our practice.
